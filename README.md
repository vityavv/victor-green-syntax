#Victor's Green Syntax Theme

An amazing syntax theme for the Atom text editor, featuring GREEN as the lead color. I use it with [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui) but I can't say "Works best with" because I didn't use all of the major UI themes.

**NOTE: THIS THEME IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO FINISHED. I JUST OPENED A CSS, JS, AND HTML FILE AND TWEAKED IT. THIS THEME WILL CONSTANTLY BE IMPROVING.**

### Please contribute!

If you see a flaw in my great theme, feel free to send a pull request my way. Use the `@color--`, `@background` and `@foreground` variables only though, as I don't want to change the colors
